Minecraft server discord bot. Iterated over several years based on needs. Requires a "path_list.xml" file in the following structure:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<paths>
    <manifesto>path/to/shitpost1</manifesto>
    <pasta>path/to/shitpost2</pasta>
    <ip_test_url>https://api.ipify.org</ip_test_url>
    <discord_token>Token</discord_token>
</paths>

The manifesto and pasta could be edited out of the code, but ip_test_url and discord_token are required for functionality.
